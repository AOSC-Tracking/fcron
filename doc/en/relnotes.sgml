	    <para>The building process has changed quite significantly from version 3.0.2 to version 3.0.3 to make it more standard and packager-friendly. As a result, fcron won't be installed in the same paths as the previous versions by default: please pay attention to the installation paths displayed at the end of the ./configure output and use ./configure's options to change them if necessary.</para>
	    <para>PAM support has not been tested thoroughly. Help from a PAM
	       expert would be appreciated (to audit the PAM code in fcron, and
	       test it). You can disable PAM use in configure, using
	       "--with-pam=no".</para>
