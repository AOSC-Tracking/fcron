    <para>Here are some things that should be done ... Note that some of these entries
 are just some ideas, which <emphasis>may</emphasis> be done in the long run.</para>
    <para>If you plan to help me, please send a mail at &email; to prevent two
people from doing the same thing. You can send me some propositions as
well.</para>

	    <para>Use directory notifications (?) (portable ?) (cf. dnotify)</para>

	    <para>PAM support (included in fcron, but needs more tests by people 
using PAM - not implemented in fcrondyn)</para>

	    <para>implement more commands for fcrondyn, and make it more secure

	    <para>add a return code for jobs which would mean that they should
not be run again (in case of an error, etc...).</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>add a system of modules : at startup, fcron loads some modules
(.so files). Then, when fcron should run the job, it calls a function of the
module, and let it manage the job (threads ?). (do linux dlopen(), etc exist on
other systems ?).</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>(related to the system of modules ? create a kind of dependencies ?)
Add a way to run a job only if a command returns true. It would permit, for instance,
to run some jobs on a laptop only if it is on AC power.</para>

	    <para>add a system of data flow</para>

	    <para>Add a way to stop a job (SIGSTOP) if the lavg gets to high, and 
restart it (SIGCONT) when the lavg has decreased.</para>
