    <para>Here are some things that should be done ... Note that some of these entries
 are just some ideas, which <emphasis>may</emphasis> be done in the long run.</para>
    <para>If you plan to help me, please send a mail at &email; to prevent two
people from doing the same thing. You can send me some propositions as
well.</para>

		<para>add a new FAQ entry : what should be done to completely replace vixie cron by fcron ? Are there some incompatibilities ?</para>

	<listitem>
	    <para>Use directory notifications (?) (portable ?) (cf. dnotify)</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>PAM support (included in fcron, but needs more tests by people 
using PAM - not implemented in fcrondyn : is it needed if fcrondyn anyway ?)</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>implement more commands for fcrondyn, and make it more secure
and reliable</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>add a timezone option instead of the tzdiff (so it would look like !timezone(europe/paris)) (?)</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>For environment settings, make a var substitution.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>add a return code for jobs which would mean that they should
not be run again (in case of an error, etc...).</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>add a system of modules : at startup, fcron loads some modules
(.so files). Then, when fcron should run the job, it calls a function of the
module, and let it manage the job (threads ?). (do linux dlopen(), etc exist on
other systems ? - yes : thanks Harring ;) dlopen exists on all POSIX system - even windoze - abait it does not use the same insterface of function calls. But it can be easily implemented to port to another system.).</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>(related to the system of modules ? create a kind of dependencies ?)
Add a way to run a job only if a command returns true. It would permit, for instance,
to run some jobs on a laptop only if it is on AC power.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>add a system of data flow</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>Add a way to stop a job (SIGSTOP) if the lavg gets to high, and 
restart it (SIGCONT) when the lavg has decreased.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>Add a timeout for task completion : if a task takes more than
a specified timeout, then start another script with the initial task PID as argument. 
That would allow a kill with different signals (-HUP, -TERM -STOP, .... or 
any other action like sending a mail to sysadmin to alert him/her that a task is taking 
too much time and that he has to have a look at it.) </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	    <para>Add a directory similar to xinet.d or logrotate.d
 to add job entries (?).</para>
