their options, time and date of next execution, status, of only the running
jobs, all the jobs, in order of execution or classified by user, etc. (some of
these functions or not implemented yet)</para>

	    <para>add a system of modules : at startup, fcron loads some modules
(.so files). Then, when fcron should run the job, it calls a function of the

other systems ?).</para>
