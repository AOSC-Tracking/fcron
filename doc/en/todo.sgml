	       <para>add a system of modules : at startup, fcron loads some modules
		  (.so files). Then, when fcron should run the job, it calls a
		  function of the module, and let it manage the job (threads
		  ?). (do linux dlopen(), etc exist on other systems ? - yes :
		  thanks Harring ;) dlopen exists on all POSIX system - even
		  windoze - abait it does not use the same insterface of function
		  calls. But it can be easily implemented to port to another
		  system.).</para>
	    </listitem>
	    <listitem>
	       <para>(related to the system of modules ? create a kind of
		  dependencies ?)  Add a way to run a job only if a command returns
		  true. It would permit, for instance, to run some jobs on a laptop
		  only if it is on AC power.</para>

	    <listitem>
	       <para>Add a timeout for task completion : if a task takes more than
		  a specified timeout, then start another script with the initial
		  task PID as argument.  That would allow a kill with different
		  signals (-HUP, -TERM -STOP, .... or any other action like sending
		  a mail to sysadmin to alert him/her that a task is taking too
		  much time and that he has to have a look at it.) </para>
